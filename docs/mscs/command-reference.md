# Command Reference

All commands below assume that you are running them as either the `minecraft` user or as `root` (through sudo).
Please note that if the script is run as the `root` user, all important server processes will be started using the
`minecraft` user instead for security purposes.

__Usage:  `mscs [<options>] <action>`__

{: .fs-1 }
The `[<options>]` argument is optional and is not typically used. We list options at the end of this page.
