# Technic/Tekkit Pack

> This example was written for [Attack of the B-Team][attack_bteam] version 1.0.9c

This works for many of the Technic/Tekkit based modpacks, although some settings may need to be adjusted for different
modpacks.

Create the world:

```bash
mscs create bteam 25565
```

`bteam` can be replaced with any name. Ensure that port `25565` is an unused port, or change it if nessessary.

This will create the directory `bteam` in `/opt/mscs/worlds` as well as the `server.properties` and `mscs.properties`
files:

Change the directory to the world that was created:

```bash
cd /opt/mscs/worlds/bteam
```

Rename `server.properties` to `server.properties.bak` so a back up of these settings is available

```bash
mv server.properties server.properties.bak
```

These settings can be used in case `server.properties` is overwritten or deleted

```ini
level-name=bteam
server-port=25565
server-ip=
enable-query=true
query.port=25565
```

[Download][download] the mod pack to the world directory

```bash
wget http://servers.technicpack.net/Technic/servers/bteam/BTeam_Server_v1.0.12c.zip
```

Unzip the mod pack

```bash
unzip <current_version>.zip
```

While unzipping, it may ask to overwrite `server.properties`

If you first renamed `server.properties` to `server.properties.bak` it should not ask to overwrite

Move or remove the zip

```bash
mv <current_version>.zip /path/to/final/location/
rm <current_version>.zip
```

Edit `mscs.properties` and add these settings

If a setting below already exists in `mscs.properties`, replace it with these

```ini
mscs-client-version=1.6.4
mscs-initial-memory=2G
mscs-maximum-memory=3G
mscs-server-jar=BTeam.jar
mscs-server-location=/opt/mscs/worlds/bteam
```

Merge the settings from `server.properties.bak` to the `server.properties` file created by the Technic pack.

You should replace any setting from Technic's `server.properties` with the setting found in the backup `server.properties.bak`

```ini
level-name=bteam
server-port=25565
server-ip=
enable-query=true
query.port=25565
```

Start the server

```bash
mscs start bteam
```

The server should start up and run
The server startup can be monitored by running:

```bash
mscs console bteam
```

Once you are done watching the server boot up, you can press `<Ctrl-D>` to detach.
